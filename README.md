# To-Do-List-Datastructures-in-C
INTRODUCTION 
The program “TO DO LIST” is a C program coded on a Unix platform and gcc compiler. It is a text based program. It is basically used to keep a track of all you to do activities like experiments and assignments. The data structure used in this project is Link List. 
 
WHY THIS PROJECT 
The most basic reason for selecting this project is our (student’s) need to keep an ongoing track of all the activities that are to be done within a deadline. We have limited this program to experiment track recording, but this can be extended to a larger scale. As of now this project helps a student to store his experiment details in a .dat file and also he can view them as and when he wants to. It also shows the overdue experiments and hence helps a student to manage his activities. 
 
DATA STRUCTURE USED 
The data structure used in our project is link list. 
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. 

CONCLUSION 
Hence we learnt to effectively used linked lists in data management with the help of a real life example
